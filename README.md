An indexed identification for open-source quotations and authourisations

KSI is short for KamaSourceIdentifier. KSI belongs to Kamacite China Organisation and does not operate under any license.

Any misuse such as copy, unnoted quotation, etc, could cause serious jurisdiction troubles.

We are an indexed open-source identification tool that issues a unique ident.code to those who wish for honest and trackable usage and quotation of their work containing and does not only contain: Website (source code, UI, css), Programming (Front, Back), Literature (Any yet unpublicized work), Artwork (Picture, painting, etc).

Our ident.code's format, example given is: KSI CN W00001 Qizhen Young

The second slot is the country/region registered, China as examplified.

The third slot is the sequence registered, and the capped letter refers to the categories mentioned above. W is web.
The fourth slot is the owner of the code, and please note that it must be contained in the ident.code or else would be considered illegal replication.

We will put a chart in the repo containing all of the indexed KSI ident.codes. 

Also note that upon registration, you agree that KSI counts as a quotation and can be used to refer to your work. Also, we insist to have one ident.code per project.
